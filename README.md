Here’s a detailed README file for your DevOps internship assignment that explains your approach. I have written it in a clear and straightforward style, as requested, to ensure it sounds like it's coming from you.

# DevOps CI/CD Pipeline for Node.js Application

## Overview

This project implements a Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for a simple Node.js application using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is designed to automatically:

1. Run tests on pull requests.
2. Build a Docker image and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster using `kubectl`.
3. Send notifications to Slack upon deployment success or failure.

---

## Project Structure

The project contains the following main components:

1. **Node.js Application**: A basic Express application with two endpoints:
   - `GET /`: Returns "Hello, World!"
   - `GET /health`: Returns "OK"
   
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow**: A YAML file defining the CI/CD pipeline, located in `.github/workflows/main.yml`.

3. **Dockerfile**: Defines the Docker image for the application.

4. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Defines the Kubernetes resources required to deploy the Docker container.

---

## Setup and Approach

### 1. **Node.js Application**

I’ve built a simple Node.js application using Express. The app has two main routes:

- `/` - Returns a basic "Hello, World!" message.
- `/health` - Returns an "OK" status code to check if the application is running.

The application is located in the `src/` directory with the main file being `app.js`.

### 2. **CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions**

The pipeline is defined in `.github/workflows/main.yml`. Here’s how the steps are organized:

#### a. **Run Tests on Pull Requests**

We use Jest for testing the application. The tests check if the application endpoints return the expected responses. The tests run automatically on every pull request:

- Test `GET /` returns "Hello, World!"
- Test `GET /health` returns "OK"

#### b. **Build and Push Docker Image**

Upon successful tests, the workflow builds a Docker image using the `Dockerfile` in the repository. The image is tagged with the current Git commit SHA and pushed to Docker Hub (or another container registry if specified).

```yaml
- name: Build Docker image
  run: |
    docker build -t myusername/myapp:${GITHUB_SHA} .
    docker push myusername/myapp:${GITHUB_SHA}
```

#### c. **Deploy to Kubernetes**

The workflow deploys the built Docker image to a Kubernetes cluster. For this, I used `kubectl` to interact with the cluster. The deployment process includes creating a deployment and exposing it via a service:

```yaml
- name: Deploy to Kubernetes
  run: |
    kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml
    kubectl apply -f k8s/service.yaml
```

The deployment YAML files (`deployment.yaml` and `service.yaml`) define the necessary Kubernetes resources for the application.

#### d. **Slack Notifications**

We use a Slack webhook to send notifications about the status of the deployment. The webhook URL is stored as a secret in GitHub Actions (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`). If the deployment is successful, a message is sent to Slack indicating that the deployment was successful. If it fails, a failure message is sent instead.

```yaml
- name: Notify on Slack
  uses: rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2
  with:
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL }}
    message: "Deployment completed successfully!"
```

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd <repo_name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the application locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   This will start the Node.js app locally on port `3000`.

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

---

## How I Use the CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow

1. **Create a new pull request**: When you create a new pull request, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the CI pipeline, which will:
   - Run the tests on the code changes.
   - Build the Docker image if the tests pass.
   - Deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster.
   - Send a Slack notification about the deployment status.

2. **Check Slack for notifications**: You’ll receive a notification in Slack indicating whether the deployment was successful or failed.

---

## Additional Notes

- **Secrets Configuration**: 
   - The **Slack Webhook URL** is stored securely as a GitHub secret (`SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`).
   - **Kubernetes credentials** are configured in the workflow for authentication with the cluster.
   
- **Docker**: The project assumes that Docker is installed on the system and accessible to the GitHub Actions runner.

---

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates a full CI/CD pipeline for a Node.js application using GitHub Actions. It automates testing, Docker image creation, Kubernetes deployment, and Slack notifications, ensuring smooth and efficient deployments in any development environment.
